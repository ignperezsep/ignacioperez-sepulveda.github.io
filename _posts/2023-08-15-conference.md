Last week, I travelled to Boston to attend to the 2023 Annual Meeting of Academy of Management. 
Here, I presented my work on "Teams' Media Capabilities: An Alternative Approach to the Study of Team Virtuality".

I had a nice time in Boston and met great researchers in my area, like Prof. Sharon Hill, Prof. Sumita Raghuram, and Dr. Maria Ximena Hincapie.
