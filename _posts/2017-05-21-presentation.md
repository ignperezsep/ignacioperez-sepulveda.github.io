Hi there,  
Firts of all, Thank you so much for stop by my personal webpage.
The main motivation of this is to share my professional knowledge and materials that can be helpful to you.
I really hope that all the information and examples fulfil your needs.


I will focus in research on teams, particularly virtual and hybrid teams. 
I will also talk about quantitative research methodolodies, such as CFA, SEM, regression analyses, and others.
